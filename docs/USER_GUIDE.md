## Getting Started

### What is Rabbit Launchpad?

Rabbit Launchpad is a decentralized platform that allows anyone to create and trade tokens using a bonding curve mechanism. Unlike traditional token launches, there are no pre-sales, special investors, or admin privileges - every token starts with a fair launch.

### Key Concepts

#### 🔄 Bonding Curve
- Tokens start at a very low price
- Price increases as more people buy
- Price decreases when people sell
- No need for liquidity providers

#### 🎯 Graduation System
- When a token reaches its target market cap, it "graduates"
- Graduated tokens get listed on decentralized exchanges (DEX)
- Liquidity is automatically created on PancakeSwap

#### 💰 Fee Structure
- **Buy Fee**: 1% of transaction amount
- **Sell Fee**: 0.25% of transaction amount
- **Total Fee**: 1.25% (much lower than traditional platforms)

### Platform Benefits

✅ **Fair Launch**: No pre-sales or special allocations
✅ **Low Fees**: Total 1.25% trading fees
✅ **No Lock-ups**: Trade anytime, no vesting periods
✅ **Transparent**: All transactions on blockchain
✅ **Simple**: Easy token creation and trading
