## 📈 Understanding Bonding Curves

### How Prices Work

#### **Exponential Bonding Curve**
- **Start Price**: 0.00000001 BNB per token
- **Price Increases**: As more tokens are bought
- **Formula**: Price = Base × e^(k × supply/supply_constant)

#### **Price Movement Example**
```
Initial Price: 0.00000001 BNB
After 100M sold: 0.0000001 BNB (10x increase)
After 500M sold: 0.001 BNB (100x increase)
Near Graduation: Much higher price
```

#### **Market Cap Progress**
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 tokens
- **Trading Supply**: 800,000,000 tokens (80%)
- **Graduation Target**: 35 BNB raised
- **Graduation Supply**: 200,000,000 tokens (20%)

### Why Bonding Curves?

#### **Benefits**
- 🎯 **Fair Price Discovery**: Price based on supply/demand
- 🚀 **Early Rewards**: Early buyers get better prices
- 💧 **Liquidity**: Always available to trade
- 🔄 **Graduation**: Automatic DEX listing

#### **Risks**
- ⚠️ **Volatility**: Prices can change rapidly
- 📉 **Price Decrease**: Selling reduces price
- 🎲 **Speculative**: High risk, high reward
- ⏰ **Timing**: Important for profits

## 🎓 Token Graduation

### What is Graduation?

When a token reaches the target (35 BNB raised), it "graduates" to a DEX with liquidity.

#### **Graduation Process**
1. **Target Reached**: 35 BNB total raised
2. **Liquidity Creation**: 80% of BNB + 200M tokens
3. **DEX Listing**: Automatic PancakeSwap listing
4. **Trading Continues**: On DEX with liquidity pool

#### **Graduation Benefits**
- 🏦 **DEX Listing**: Official PancakeSwap listing
- 💧 **Permanent Liquidity**: Liquidity pool locked
- 📊 **Price Discovery**: Market-driven pricing
- 🔗 **External Exposure**: Listed on DEX aggregators

#### **Graduation Timeline**
```
Target Reached → Liquidity Creation → DEX Listing → Complete
    (~30 sec)        (~1 min)          (~2 min)
```
