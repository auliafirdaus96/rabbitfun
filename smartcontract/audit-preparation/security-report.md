# Rabbit Launchpad Smart Contract Security Audit Report

## 📋 **Audit Preparation Package**

### **🔍 Contract Overview**
- **Project Name:** Rabbit Launchpad
- **Smart Contracts:** RabbitLaunchpad.sol, RabbitToken.sol
- **Network:** BSC (Binance Smart Chain)
- **Solidity Version:** ^0.8.19
- **Compiler Version:** Latest compatible

### **📚 Documentation for Auditor**

#### **Contract Purpose**
RabbitLaunchpad is a decentralized token launchpad platform that enables:
1. Token creation with exponential bonding curve pricing
2. Fair token distribution with anti-manipulation mechanisms
3. Graduated launchpad tokens to external DEX
4. Secure fee collection and treasury management

#### **Key Features**
- **Bonding Curve Pricing:** Exponential curve for price discovery
- **Anti-Front Running:** Time-based ordering and fair distribution
- **Reentrancy Protection:** ReentrancyGuard implementation
- **Access Control:** Owner-based admin functions
- **Emergency Functions:** Pause/resume and emergency withdrawal
- **Graduation Logic:** Auto-graduation to PancakeSwap

### **🛡️ Security Measures Implemented**

#### **1. Access Control**
```solidity
- Only owner can call emergency functions
- Treasury address configurable by owner
- Contract pausing mechanism
```

#### **2. Reentrancy Protection**
```solidity
- ReentrancyGuard on all external functions
- State updates before external calls
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
```

#### **3. Input Validation**
```solidity
- Address zero checks
- Overflow/underflow protection (Solidity 0.8+)
- Valid token name/symbol validation
- Amount bounds checking
```

#### **4. Economic Safeguards**
```solidity
- Maximum supply caps
- Minimum funding requirements
- Fee rate limits
- Graduation thresholds
```

### **⚠️ Known Vulnerabilities Addressed**

#### **1. Reentrancy**
- ✅ ReentrancyGuard implemented
- ✅ External calls after state changes
- ✅ No recursive function calls

#### **2. Integer Overflow/Underflow**
- ✅ Solidity 0.8+ automatic protection
- ✅ Additional checks where needed
- ✅ SafeMath pattern for critical calculations

#### **3. Front Running**
- ✅ Block.timestamp for ordering
- ✅ Slippage protection mechanisms
- ✅ Minimum/maximum amount bounds

#### **4. Flash Loan Attacks**
- ✅ No flash loan dependencies
- ✅ Price impact calculations
- ✅ Graduation safeguards

#### **5. Access Control**
- ✅ OnlyOwner modifiers
- ✅ Treasury address validation
- ✅ Emergency function protections
