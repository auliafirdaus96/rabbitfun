- Consider adding time-based withdrawal limits

## Gas Analysis

### Current Gas Usage Estimates
- **Token Transfer:** ~50,000 gas
- **Bonding Curve Purchase:** ~120,000 gas
- **Token Minting:** ~80,000 gas

### Optimization Opportunities
- Cache frequently accessed storage variables
- Use uint256 instead of smaller uint types when possible
- Optimize loop structures in bulk operations

## Best Practices Compliance

### ‚úÖ Follows Best Practices
- Semantic versioning
- Comprehensive documentation
- Standard interface implementations
- Proper event emission
- Access control implementation

### üîÑ Areas for Improvement
- Consider implementing upgradeability patterns
- Add more comprehensive test coverage

- Add more detailed inline documentation

## Recommendations

### High Priority (Immediate)
1. Review bonding curve mathematical operations for precision and overflow protection

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)
1. Add comprehensive input validation
2. Implement pausable functionality
3. Add emergency withdrawal mechanisms

### Low Priority (Future Enhancements)
1. Gas optimization improvements
2. Additional logging and monitoring
3. Upgradeability considerations

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test all mathematical operations with edge cases
   - Test access control mechanisms
   - Test withdrawal and deposit functions

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test full bonding curve operations
   - Test token distribution scenarios
   - Test emergency scenarios

3. **Security Tests**
   - Test reentrancy attack scenarios
   - Test overflow/underflow conditions
   - Test access control bypass attempts

## Next Steps

1. Address medium impact findings
2. Enhance test coverage
3. Consider professional third-party audit
4. Deploy to testnet for thorough testing
5. Gradual mainnet deployment with monitoring

## Conclusion

The Rabbit Launchpad smart contracts demonstrate good security practices with the use of audited OpenZeppelin libraries and proper access control mechanisms. The identified issues are moderate to low risk and can be addressed with reasonable effort. The overall security posture is good, but addressing the mathematical precision and overflow protection in the bonding curve calculations should be prioritized.

**Overall Risk Rating: LOW-MEDIUM**
